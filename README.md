# Practice

I'll be uploading coding and machine learning practice exercises I do for
university or just for fun!!

# Exercises
- *HMMfiltering.py*
    Implementation of a HMM filtering model from Nando de Freitas lecture on
machine learning at UBC. http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/340-2012/lectures/l6.pdf

- *flappybird.c*
    Little terminal game, inspired by the original Flappy Bird. It runs in the
terminal window. The library used to develop it is curses.h. I build it to
practice the C programming language having fun!

- *PageRank.c*
    Small Google's PageRank algorithm implementation in C. I wrote the program 
when first learning about matrices in C. It helped me practicing C and 
understanding how the algorithm works.

- *HuAlert*
    App prototype in Python. Uses the OpenCV library for computer vision.
That's the project that came out of the 2017 Wired Next Fest Hackathon in
Milan, Italy.

- *SimpleLinearRegression*
    Python notebook for simple linear regression, numpy and matplotlib are
used.
